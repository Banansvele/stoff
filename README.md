Hi! This is the new Wordpress theme for STOFF Magasin, developed by Sigurd Vikene in the summer of 2022.

Our goals with this project were to align the site's style with the physical magazine, 
as well as making it more robust, intuitive and maintainable for the editors. STOFF is a voluntary student organization, so the site needs to be cost effective and easy to use for a rotating gallery of people with little to no technical knowledge. Another key feature is the added oppurtunity for advertising.

Here's the previous theme, which was quite messy as stated by the creator himself:
